# Large Image Solution Pack [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Islandora/islandora_solution_pack_large_image.png?branch=7.x)](https://travis-ci.org/Islandora/islandora_solution_pack_large_image)

## Introduction

The Large Image Solution Pack loads all required Fedora objects and creates an empty collection object to accept TIFFs and JPEG2000s (JP2) and create derivatives, and also supports the installation of image viewers that can accommodate the larger resolution.

## Requirements

This module requires the following modules/libraries:

* [Islandora](https://github.com/islandora/islandora)
* [Tuque](https://github.com/islandora/tuque)
* [ImageMagick](https://drupal.org/project/imagemagick) (for `TN` and `JPG`
    derivative generation)

For JP2 derivative generation, we require at least one of:
* Kakadu (bundled with Djatoka)
* Imagemagick with JPEG 2000 support

## Installation

Install as usual, see [this](https://drupal.org/documentation/install/modules-themes/modules-7) for further information.

## Configuration

Configure the image-toolkit to use ImageMagick rather than GD in Administration > Configuration > Media > Image Toolkit (admin/config/media/image-toolkit). If GD is selected, TN and JPG datastreams will not be generated.

![Configuration](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/6ae64673716ddf1f58d0e4856d7d7a5d79845506/687474703a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f4f33735150654f2e706e67)

Select configuration options and viewer in Administration > Islandora > Large Image Collection (admin/islandora/large_image).

To use Kakadu, make sure that `kdu_compress` is available to the Apache user. Often users will create symbolic links from `/usr/local/bin/kdu_compress` to their installation of Kakadu that comes bundled with [Adore-Djatoka](http://sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/djatoka/index.php?title=Installation). If the executable resides elsewhere on the server and no soft link has been created, be sure to provide the full path to the executable on the configuration page. Make sure that the required dynamic libraries that come with Kakadu are accessible to `kdu_compress` and `kdu_expand`. If they are not present, attempting to run either command from the terminal will inform you that the libraries are missing. You can also use a symbolic link from `/usr/local/lib` to include these libraries. Remember to restart the terminal so your changes take affect. Also, make sure the php settings allow for enough memory and upload size: `upload_max_filesize`, `post_max_size` and `memory_limit`.

![Configuration](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/3730f86cd795d7d989e1cbb9b5dfca5221228379/687474703a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f625335706834412e706e67)


####  To change the size of the thumbnail and medium size image derivatives
These are handled as maximum sizes (retains original x to y ratio) and does not crop.

```shell
# For thumbnail size
drush vset derivative_tn_size "200 x 200"

# For Medium sized JPEG size
drush vset derivative_med_size "600 x 800"
```
To remove
```shell
# For thumbnail size
drush vdel derivative_tn_size

# For Medium sized JPEG size
drush vdel derivative_med_size
```
